# Adventure Project Week

This week you'll be completing a Django backend to support a multi-user
dungeon (MUD) game called _LambdaMUD_. The backend is partially written,
but needs to be completed.

In addition, you'll write a frontend to interface with the game.

Push notifications will be implemented using the Pusher API so that
other players can see when you've walked into a room, etc.

You are to treat this week as if you are working at a company and the
instructor is your client. The project managers will be your main
support throughout the week.

The main objective of this week is to develop the MVP feature set listed
below using any other technologies you have learned here at Lambda
School. There are design files in this repository you should use as a
creative guide.

## Git Commits

- You are required to showcase progress with at least 1 commit a day.
  This will let your project manager know where you are and if you need
  help. This also allows the client to get progress reports from the
  company in a real world setting.

## Trello Set Up:

- [ ] Create a Trello account if you don't have one already
- [ ] Create a new board called "LambdaMUD - {Your Name}"
- [ ] Create lists titled `backlog`,`To Do`, `In Progress`, and `Done`
- [ ] Fill in the `To Do` list with the MVP features listed below
- [ ] Fill in the `backlog` list with all the extra features listed below
- [ ] Share your board with the project manager that has been assigned to you. If you have not been assigned yet, reach out to your lead PM for guidance
- [ ] Add your Trello URL to your project's README.md file. Commit the change, push it to your repository & submit a pull request

## MVP Features:

- [ ] **TODO: what server features?**
- [ ] Be able to create a new account on the server
- [ ] Be able to log in to the server
- [ ] Be able to move cardinal directions, `n`, `s`, `w`, and `e`

direct message your project manager for approval. If approved, you may
continue working on the Extra Features.**

MVP as soon as you can and get working the list of features.

## Extra Features:
